# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python 📊🐍

Welcome to the **Data Analysis and Visualization with Python** project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform data analysis and create visualizations using Python’s powerful libraries. The dataset used in this project is built-in and does not require external files.

---

## 📝 Overview

In this project, the main goal is to showcase how to analyze a dataset and visualize the insights using Python libraries like `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`. The steps involved in the project include:

1. **Loading the Built-in Dataset**: The dataset is automatically loaded and ready for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Basic cleaning such as handling missing values and correcting data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical analysis to discover patterns, trends, and correlations.
4. **Visualization**: Generating charts and graphs to visually represent the dataset.

## 🔧 Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `Pandas` for data manipulation
- `Matplotlib` for static visualizations
- `Seaborn` for advanced visualizations
- `Plotly` for interactive plots

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## 📂 Project Structure

This project is simple and contains only one Jupyter notebook that carries out the analysis:

```

└── README.md                     # Project documentation and overview
```

## 🔍 Data Analysis

The **data_analysis.ipynb** notebook performs the analysis and visualizations on a built-in dataset. Here's what you will find inside the notebook:

### 1. **Loading the Built-in Dataset** 📥

The dataset is loaded using `Pandas` from an in-built source, so no additional data files are needed. The dataset is ready for immediate use in the analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the built-in dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')
df.head()
```

### 2. **Data Cleaning** 🧹

This step includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring the data is ready for analysis.

```python
df = df.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].astype('int')  # Convert column type
```

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍

In this section, we perform statistical analysis and examine relationships between features using basic summaries and visualizations.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

This project features several types of visualizations created to better understand the data:

### 1. **Distribution Plot** 📈

This plot shows the distribution of values in a numerical column.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.distplot(df['column_name'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Column')
plt.show()
```

---

### 2. **Correlation Heatmap** 🌡️

A heatmap is generated to show correlations between different numerical variables in the dataset.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

---

### 3. **Scatter Plot** 📍

A scatter plot is used to observe the relationship between two numerical features.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.scatterplot(x=df['feature1'], y=df['feature2'])
plt.title('Feature1 vs Feature2')
plt.xlabel('Feature1')
plt.ylabel('Feature2')
plt.show()
```

## 📈 Insights & Results

From the analysis and visualizations, the following insights were derived:

- **Insight 1**: The `column_name` shows a skewed distribution, indicating a concentration of lower values.
- **Insight 2**: The correlation heatmap reveals a strong relationship between `feature1` and `feature2`.
- **Insight 3**: The scatter plot further supports the linear relationship between these two features.
