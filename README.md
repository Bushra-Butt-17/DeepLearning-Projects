# Iris Classification 🌸

This project demonstrates a deep learning model for classifying the **Iris** dataset, which contains three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each species.

## Key Steps 🔑:

- **Data Preprocessing** 🧹: Clean the dataset and apply feature scaling to improve model performance.
- **Model Architecture** 🏗️: Build a neural network using Keras for multi-class classification.
- **Training & Evaluation** 📊: Train the model and evaluate its accuracy in classifying the Iris species.

## Key Insights 🔍:

- **Setosa's Distinct Sepal Length** 📏: Setosa typically has shorter sepal lengths, which are clearly visible in the **distribution plot**.  

- **Overlap Between Versicolor and Virginica** 🤝: These two species show some overlap in sepal length, but Virginica generally has longer sepals.  

- **Petal Length Distribution** 🌺: Setosa has a narrow range of petal lengths, while Versicolor and Virginica have broader distributions. Virginica generally has longer petals.  

- **Pairplot Overview** 🔠: The **pairplot** shows that Setosa is easily distinguishable from Versicolor and Virginica, especially in terms of petal length and width, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly.

# 🏡 Ames Housing Price Prediction: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This project demonstrates how to build a linear regression model from scratch using the **Ames Housing Dataset** 🏘️. It includes:  

- Implementing the **Gradient Descent algorithm** for optimizing model parameters.  
- Analyzing the data to gain insights and visualize trends.  
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like RMSE.  
- Visualizing results such as **learning curves** and feature impacts.  

The project is organized as follows:  

- **Main Notebook**: All analysis and code are consolidated in the `linear-regression-with-gd.ipynb` file.  
- **Dataset**: Located in the `data` directory as `Ames_Housing.csv`.  
- **Visualizations**: Plots and images are stored in the `visualizations` directory, showcasing learning curves and insights.
