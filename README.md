# Iris Classification 🌸

This project demonstrates a deep learning model for classifying the **Iris** dataset, which contains three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each species.

## Key Steps 🔑:

- **Data Preprocessing** 🧹: Clean the dataset and apply feature scaling to improve model performance.
- **Model Architecture** 🏗️: Build a neural network using Keras for multi-class classification.
- **Training & Evaluation** 📊: Train the model and evaluate its accuracy in classifying the Iris species.

## Key Insights 🔍:

- **Setosa's Distinct Sepal Length** 📏: Setosa typically has shorter sepal lengths, which are clearly visible in the **distribution plot**.  

- **Overlap Between Versicolor and Virginica** 🤝: These two species show some overlap in sepal length, but Virginica generally has longer sepals.  

- **Petal Length Distribution** 🌺: Setosa has a narrow range of petal lengths, while Versicolor and Virginica have broader distributions. Virginica generally has longer petals.  

- **Pairplot Overview** 🔠: The **pairplot** shows that Setosa is easily distinguishable from Versicolor and Virginica, especially in terms of petal length and width, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly.
